## SDKMAN
ah


## Cool git command
You can create a new branch from any previous commit or tag using a single command
`git checkout -b new-branch-name tag-or-commit-hash`
This will create a new branch from that tag or version and will switch to it

## Remember
1. Git tag does not care about branches
2. Jitpack does not care about branches
