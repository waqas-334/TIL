## Zero Knowledge (ZKE)
The data is encrypted on your device before it is sent over to the servers, the server stores the ciphertext only, the key is stored by the client. If client loses the key, their data can never be recovered. Means Server has ZERO knowledge of client data. 

## How keys work for Android Project
You can create anyfile in Android project with .properties extension and everything in it will be available in build.gradle.kts. So you can create a file say keystore.properties, put path to your JKS, Keystore Password, Key Alias and Key password.

```
KEYSTORE_PATH=../keys/seenaApps.jks
KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=somePassword
KEY_ALIAS=key0
KEY_PASSWORD=somePassword
```

And then access them in build.gradle.kts to sign the app as 
```

val keystoreProps = Properties()
val keystorePropsFile = rootProject.file("keystore.properties")

if (keystorePropsFile.exists()) {
    keystoreProps.load(FileInputStream(keystorePropsFile))
}

//Now we can access the content as 
keystoreProps.getProperty("KEYSTORE_PATH") 
keystoreProps.getProperty("KEYSTORE_PASSWORD")

```


## Setting up keys for CI
For github actions you can save the keys in Settings>Secrents>Actions, create variables, set the values and then pass them to build.gradle via command line. They work as environment variables but only useable in workflow.
