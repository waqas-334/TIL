## S3 Lifecycle
You can setup rules to automatically transition or expire obkects in the bucket
- These rules aren't based on access, that's Intelligent Tiering's job. You can not set a rule to move object to a different class if it is not accessed in 30 days etc.
- Transition Rules can only transition objects in downward direction, from S3 Standaed -> Stand IA -> Intelligent Riering > One Zone IA -> Glacier Instant Retrieval -> Flexible Retrieval -> Glacier Deep Archive
- Moving smaller obkects from Standard to Standard-IA or Inteliigent Tiering or One-Zone IA can cost more because of the minimum billiable in the target storage class
- Object must remain on S3 Standed for atleast 30 days before it is moved anywhere else, you can move manually whenever you want but not with the rule. 
- A Single Rule can not transition to Standard-IA or One-Zone IA and then to Glacier classes within 30 days. 


## S3 Replication

### Cross Region Replication (CRR)
### Same Region Replication (SRR)

- Can be between two buckets in same or different account
- Need Bucket Policy to allow that Role to write to the bucket if transfer is between two accounts
