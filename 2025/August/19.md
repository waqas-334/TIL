## Terminal Command - dd
dd is `data duplicator` we can use this command to duplicate data or copy data from source to destination
it requires 
- `if` = input file
- `of` = output file
- `bs` = block size, not mandatory though, if not provided it uses default block size of 512 bytes.
- `count` = how many blocks, not mandatory though, defaults to "copy until input ends"
- `status` = how you want to see the status, if none (default) no progress, `progress` means show all the progress, `noxfer` means show the final transfer report etc. But learning progress would be more than enough.


## /dev/zero
A special device file that produces an endless stream of 0x00 bytes, reading from it gives you as many zeros as you want.
Can be used to wipe a disk by copying all the zeros to the disk, that will overwrite the existing bytes
Or to create blank files with fixed sizes like the following command will create a 100MB file filled with zeros
`dd if=/dev/zero of=newFile.bin bs=1M count=100`

## /dev/urandom
Just like the `/dev/zero` this provides endless stream of random bytes. Can be used for same purpose as above one.
