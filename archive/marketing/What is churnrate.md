# What is churn rate and how it is calculated?
`7th May 2024`

Churn rate is the amount of users left your platform/business/app or whatever.

### Calculation
>Churn Rate = (Customer Lost / New Customers) * 100

So if your business lost 300 customers and it gained 1000 customer in one year then
> Churn rate  = (300/1000) * 100 = 30%

Which is too much, it should be no more than 5-7%, so you gotta workout to fix that.

### Questions?
1. What can be done to minimise that?
2. How do you know if a cusotmer left your business?
