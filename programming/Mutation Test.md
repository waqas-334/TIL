# What is mutation test?

When you write a test and it runs successfully, you may think your production code is working as expected. But it can also be a case that there is error in test code itself and it is passing all the time. 

So now you goto production code, and modify it on purpose to generate a bug and see if your test code catches it.

This is called Mutation Testing.
